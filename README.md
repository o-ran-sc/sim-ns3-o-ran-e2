# ns3-o-ran-e2 aka ns-O-RAN

================================

This ns-3 module enables the support for running multiple terminations of an O-RAN-compliant E2 interface inside the simulation process.
This module has been developed by a team at the [Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things (WIoT)](https://wiot.northeastern.edu) at Northeastern University, in collaboration with Sapienza University of Rome, the University of Padova and with support from Mavenir.

## How to use

This module can be used with an extension of the [ns3-mmWave module](https://github.com/wineslab/ns-o-ran-ns3-mmwave).
This repository must be cloned in the `contrib` folder.
Moreover, our custom version of the [e2sim library](https://github.com/wineslab/o-ran-e2sim) must be installed.
Please refer to this [quick start guide](https://openrangym.com/tutorials/ns-o-ran) that presents a tutorial to bridge ns-O-RAN and Colosseum RIC (i.e., OSC RIC bronze reduced) ns-O-RAN.
